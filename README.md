The various components of the program are explained below:

- **Home** :

  - The home page of the game provides a simple layout allowing the user to call for the toss.
  - Tossing is executed **unbiased** with the help of a modified **random** function.
  - The decisive call of the user for toss takes the user to further pages using a sequence of **_function calls_** and \*_conditional statements_.

- **Election** :

  - Result of the **unbiased toss** is displayed in a seperate page.
  - A fair chance is provided for both the computer and the player to win the toss.
  - The **random** function is brought to use again if the computer wins the toss inorder to choose between **batting** and **bowling**.
  - On the other hand, the user is allowed to choose between batting and bowling on winning the toss.

- **GamePlay** :

  - The gameplay page enables the user to choose numbers between 1 and 6 similar to the _primitive physical version_.
  - The **scores** of the computer and player are update instantly while **rendering** the page.
  - The page also displays the previous calls made by the user and the computer to help take a **stochastic decision**.
  - The **status** of the user and the **target** are also updated to trigger the enthusiasm.

- **GameOver** :

  - The game contains multiple terminal pages which will be invoked based on the result.

- **Graphical Features** :

  - The project contains **multiple graphical content** ranging from _bending of borders_ to _styled fonts_ and _eye-soothing layout_.
  - The `CSS` file checks in all the requisites for empowerment of the graphical interface.

- **JavaScript** :
  - The `JavaScript` plays the most significal role, driving the entire game.
  - The **precise algorithm** of the game manages the flow controlling everything from **function calls** to **page switches** and **score calcutions**.
